## Objective
To assess what is the best strategy to go further in terms , of realiability and background compatibility.

## Method

|   | Strategy  | Pros  | Cons  |
|---|---|---|---|
| Strategy 1  | - Cross yEK7a: dbem1dbem3dnrp1dbem2 ura3   (from Enzo) with ylic133 (alpha)   - Sporulate the diploid and select   for all deletions  without ura3 and ade2.   - Cross again with ylic133 and have   homozygous ura3 and ade2 auxotrophies.  | I keep the same background as ylic133   After having the homozygous diploid   I just select for the different   target genes.   |  Could be work demanding |
| Strategy 2   | - Cross ylic128(dbem1dbem3dnrp1) with ylic133   to form a diploid, homozygous in ura3-   - Sporulate and select for   dbem1dbem3dnrp1 ura3- ade2-   Cross againg with ylic133 to have  | Same as Strategy 1, just I wont have   bem2 in the study | - Work demanding,   because I have to select   for many markers
