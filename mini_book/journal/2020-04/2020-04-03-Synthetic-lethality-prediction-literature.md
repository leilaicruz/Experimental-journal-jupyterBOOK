# Title: Literature search


## Goals for the literature search: 
- To collect relevant published information about how the prediction of synthetic lethals has been generally carried out .
- To be able to reproduce existing results (if possible) and to have a culture of how other researchers have tackled this question.

## General goal of the project
- Our general goal is to apply supervised machine learning for this task of predicting synthetic lethals, **because we have a huge amount of data that we can use for training and testing our methods.** Hence, the part of testing if our predictions satisfy the current knowledge is straighforward and the purpose of the a supervised learning algorithm.

## Benefit from the literature search to the application of the supervised machine algorithm

- Informative datasets that has been used for the prediction of synthetic lethality.
- Design of insightful and relevant features to construct the learning.

Li, B., & Luo, F. (2009, November). 
Predicting yeast synthetic lethal genetic interactions using protein domains.

### Goal:
- Predicting SL interactions based on the protein domains a protein pair share.

---------------------------

### Data sources:
- The protein domain data was collected from Pfam (Protein families database)
- Genetic interactions of yeast were downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD)

-----------------------

### Method:
 - Support vector machine (SVM) for two class classification problem, of predicting if certain pair of proteins can be synthetic lethals or not. 
 - They used LibSVM tool in C to implement the method. 

-------------------------

### Feature encoding: 
 - Use of the protein domains to find correlations with existing synthetic lethals pairs in order to predict new ones.

### Instructions for reproducibility  

```
We chose the LibSVM tool provided by Chang et al. [19]. 
The C-Support Vector Classification in LibSVM 
is utilized in our application. We used the radial basis function kernel. 
The parameters (cost and gamma) were estimated by following the guide of 
LibSVM [20], which were selected based on the highest
  accuracy that the trained SVM classifier achieved.

### Goal: 
- To model correlations between protein interaction network properties and the existence of synthetic lethal interaction. 

----------------------------

### Data sources:
- Protein-protein interaction dataset from Reguly et al['*Comprehensive curation and analysis of global interaction networks in Saccharomyces cerevisiae*'] This dataset contains 3289 proteins and 11334 interactions.

-----------------------------

### Method:
 - Support vector machine (SVM) for two class classification problem, of predicting if certain pair of proteins can be synthetic lethals or not. 
 
-------------------------------

### Feature encoding: 
 - Use of protein interaction network graph theoretic properties:

  Global properties: 

    -a Degree
    -b Clustering coefficient
    -c Closeness centrality
    -d Normalized betweenness centrality
  <!-- -e Eigenvector centrality
  -f Stress centrality
  -g Bridging centrality
  -h Information centrality
  -i Current-flow betweenness centrality -->


  Local properties:

    - the inverse of the shortest distance
    - number of mutual neighbors between proteins p and q
    - 2Hop S-S and 2Hop S-P
  
[1]: which exploit the fact that the known synthetic genetic  network contains a large number of triangles. 2Hop S-S takes a value 1 if the genes encoding the two proteins p and q share a synthetic lethal partner and 0 otherwise, whereas 2Hop S-P takes a value 1 if there exists a protein r such that r has physical interaction with protein p and the gene corresponding to protein r has a SSL interaction with protein q or vice versa.

Chipman, K. C., & Singh, A. K. (2009). 
Predicting genetic interactions with random walks on biological networks.
 BMC bioinformatics, 10(1), 17.

### Goal

The application of randon walks to accurately predict pairwise interactions. 

------------------------------

### Data sources

- Gene Ontology
- protein-protein interaction dataset
- Data on synthetic sick and synthetic lethal interactions (BioGrid, collins et al, Davierwala et al, Tong et al)

------------------------------

### Method

- Random walks to determine the strength of the proximity between two nodes. 
- Decision Tree classifier

----------------------------

### Feature enconding

- The proximity matrices are combined with the genetic interaction data during the procedure for measuring the topological relatedness between two genes. This generates a large vector for gene pair that are introduced as feature for the decision tree. 

--------------------------

<!-- ### Instructions for reproducibility 

```
We used version 3.5.7 of the Weka [19] machine learning
software to classify gene pairs as either interacting (SSL) or
non-interacting. Specifically, we used the J48 decision tree
implementation provided with the package. We applied a
5-fold, stratified cross-validation scheme whereby four
fifths of the instances are used for training and the other
one fifth of the data is held out for testing.
