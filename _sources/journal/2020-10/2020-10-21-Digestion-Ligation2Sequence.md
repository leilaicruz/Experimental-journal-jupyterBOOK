# Title : Digestion and Ligation for sequencing 

## Date
21102020- 

## Objective

To do all the steps in order to send my samples of WT, and dnrp1 strains to sequence after doing SATAY on them. 



## Method

- DNA concentration of 2ug for digestion
    - WT (~50ng/ul) = 40ul of DNA
    - $\Delta$nrp1_1 (~50ng/ul) = 40ul of DNA
    - $\Delta$nrp1_2 (~40ng/ul) = 50ul of DNA
    
- Digestion samples:
    - 50ul final volume for WT and dnrp1_1
        - 40ul DNA
        - 5ul enzyme (250 units)
        - 5ul 10X buffer 
    - 61uL final volume for dnrp1_2
        - 50ul DNA
        - 5ul enzyme (250 units)
        - 6.1ul 10X buffer 

## Results
### Digestion


### Ligation

- 

## Conclusion
