# Title :  how do yeast cells look like during log phase at different galactose concentrations? (experiment)

## Date

24102022 (Monday)- 27102022 (Thursday)

## Objective

- Show that during log phase yeast cells with the gal promoter look OK at different galactose concentrations.
- Genotypes:
    - WT+sfGFP+pGal-CDC42(ywkd065a)
    - dbem1+sfGFP+pGal-CDC42(ywkd069b)
    - dbem1dbem3+sfGFP+pGal-CDC42(ywkd070a)
    - WT(yll3a Control)
- Gal concentrations:
    - 0%, 0.01%,0.02%,0.05%,0.06%,0.08%,0.1%,0.2%,2%

## Method

- Population growth measurements in 0,0.01,0.02,0.05,0.06,0.08,0.1,0.2,2% galactose for the following strains: WT+sfGFP+pGal-CDC42(ywkd065a),dbem1+sfGFP+pGal-CDC42(ywkd069b),dbem1dbem3+sfGFP+pGal-CDC42(ywkd070a),WT(yll3a Control).

- In the log phase of the measuring part take some  bright field images of the cell morphology in the 96 well plate. 

  - I transfer 50ul of cells to an 96 well imaging plate to take the bright field images.
  - No dilution of cells . 

## Results

- Plate layout
